Hello this is Bagas. I assume you came here because you want to know how to make financial app. I dont want to make you disappointed but this app is not so complex or something like you guys looking for. Let me introduce to you what is contained in this project.

I made this project using NextJS and Chakra UI library for the front-end and Laravel 8 for the back-end, I made the back-end as an API because I want to learn how to make REST API my self for this project and future project.

I deployed the Laravel app in Heroku for free. If you guys want to make yourself an API go try Heroku for the free hosting, dont worry its super easy for beginner like us!

You can try the project demo in <a href="https://catatanuang.vercel.app">here</a>

the <b>front-end</b> for the project is in <a href="https://github.com/wirayuda23/financial-app-frontend-">here</a>

feel free to clone the project, let's learn programming together for the better future!
